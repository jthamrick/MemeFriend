		<p>Thanks to your feedback we have been able to add the following items to the MemeFriend website.</p> 
		<p>Users can now:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use images on friend's Facebook profiles to create memes.</li>
			<li>Change the color, size, and font family of the text on memes they create.</li>
			<li>Create new memes from existing images, given the original creator has given the MemeFriend community permission to do so.</li>
			<li>Browse memes with previous and next buttons, rather than having to return to the home page to select another meme.</li>
			<li>Up-vote and down-vote memes changing what displays on the Popular Memes page.</li>
			<li>Filter and view memes based on the names users have given them.</li>
		</ul>
