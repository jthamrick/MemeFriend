		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>To access your online photos, click the “Log in with Facebook” tab on the link bar from the home page.</p>
		<p>Select one of the options under the “Create a Meme” tab on the left hand side of the page. Pictures can also be uploaded directly from your computer (.jpg format only) or imported from your Facebook profile. You can use either your own images or your friends’ images to create a meme.</p>
