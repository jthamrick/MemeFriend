This Privacy Policy  describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the website available at MemeFriend.com (the “Website”) and is made available under the Creative Commons Sharealike license. Please read this notice very carefully.</p>
		<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
		<p>Like most website operators, MemeFriend collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MemeFriend’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MemeFriend’s visitors use its Website. From time to time, MemeFriend may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website.</p>
		<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		<p>Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with MemeFriend in ways that require MemeFriend to gather personally-identifying information. MemeFriend collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with MemeFriend. MemeFriend does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
		<p>MemeFriend does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided MemeFriend with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at contact@memefriend.com. If MemeFriend becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information.</p>

		<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		<p>MemeFriend discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MemeFriend’s behalf or to provide services available at the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Moreover, if MemeFriend or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MemeFriend goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of MemeFriend may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, MemeFriend will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
		<p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, MemeFriend discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when MemeFriend believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MemeFriend, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request for removal of a photo or a contact message, we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MemeFriend takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
		<p>You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.</p>
		<p>For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>
